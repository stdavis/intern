Execution lifecycle
===================

Bootstrap file
--------------

1. Configures the default AMD loader with default loader settings
1. Reloads itself into the AMD loader
1. Loads, instantiates, and runs the pre-executor with hard-coded properties

Pre-executor
------------

1. Registers an early error handler that displays bare-bones error information if future pre-executor initialisation fails
1. Loads the requested Intern configuration and mixes in environment argument overrides
1. Swaps out the default AMD loader with replacement loader, if specified in configuration
1. Loads the actual test executor into the replacement loader
1. Instantiates and runs the actual executor, passing in previously loaded configuration + itself

Executor
--------

1. Loads and instantiates reporters (notifies: ??? just call run on them directly if it exists?)
1. Replaces the early error handler with an error handler that sends errors to reporters
1. Enables code instrumentation
1. Creates main suites for the test run (executor-specific)
1. Sets test registration function on global Intern object so test modules can register themselves
1. Loads test modules from the config (executor-specific) (notifies: newTest, newSuite)
1. Creates and starts instrumenting proxy (runner executor-specific) (notifies: proxyStart)
1. Creates and starts a WebDriver tunnel (runner executor-specific) (notifies: tunnelStart, tunnelStatus, tunnelDownloadProgress)
1. ** IN WRONG POSITION NOW ** Runs configuration preloading code (for user-defined servers, etc.)
1. Notifies that the test run is starting (notifies: runStart)
1. Runs each main suite (notifies: suiteEnd, suiteError, suiteStart, testEnd, testFail, testPass, testSkip, testStart)
1. Notifies that the test run has finished (notifies: runEnd)
1. Stops the proxy (runner executor-specific) (notifies: proxyEnd)
1. Stops the tunnel (runner executor-specific) (notifies: tunnelEnd)
1. ** MISSING NOW ** Unloads all test modules from the loader which is being inappropriately used as a DI mechanism :)
1. ** MISSING NOW ** Resets the global
1. ** MISSING NOW ** Unloads the reporters ??? (notifies: ???)

Missing: Cancelling test run in the middle
